## Final meeting
* **DATE:** 21.11.2019
* **ASSISTANTS:** Mika Oja
* **GRADE:** *To be filled by course staff*

### Minutes
*Summary of what was discussed during the meeting*

- We reviewed the finished project and noted it fulfills the MVP requirements. More careful assesment coming later.
- Noticed that there is an unnecessary subclassing of Event resources since multiple endpoints can be directed to same resources and that is a more elegant solution to the same problem.
- Testing is fairly comprehensive, but there are a few points that are not covered, mainly testing cases where database rollbacks would be initiated.

### Action points
